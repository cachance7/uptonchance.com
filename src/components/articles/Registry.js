        <p>We are just so happy to have you at the wedding â€” gifts are greatly appreciated but certainly not expected. However, if you would like to give a gift, please consider contributing to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" src="">our Honeyfund <b>LINK NEEDED</b></a> (either via link or with cash). Any gifts we receive will go towards our honeymoon in Hawaii, exploring the islands.</p>
        <p>We already live together and love the space we have built. An adventure to a new place sounds to us like a fantastic way to start our life together!</p>
